title: "Fuzzing and image reading in 0.22.3 and onwards"
---

Many use cases for decoding pixel matrices involve an inherently untrustworthy
environment. Think of a webbrowser handling media sent by potentially shady
servers or an open image processing service in the web.

`image` offers a neat yet powerful and versatile core of operations. And for
that reason it is used in a game libraries, graphics API bindings and, as the
pool of Rust programs expands, even in editors. It isn't perfect but it works
and we are grateful for every positive feedback we get.

The versatility pushed down the priority of other engineering considerations.
Here, 'fuzzing' enters the frame. For those who hear it for the first time, or
want their memory refreshed, that is the term for automated methods of finding
misbehaving inputs to programs. You can find out more in the documentation of
two prominent tools for Rust: [afl.rs][afl] and [cargo-fuzz][cargo-fuzz].
These tools together have already found a number of fixed bugs and contributed
hugely to the `png`, `gif` and `pnm` decoders.

It shouldn't come as a surprise in today's internet infrastructure that this is
available as a service as well, very similar to hosting and CI. We're also glad
to say that one allows us to their platform as an open source organization.
Thank you,

They have also been welcoming and helped out where possible with the setup. The
`png` decoder in particular has been happily running and did not turn up
anything, while having generated a corpus of new test cases for CI -- very
unique valid and invalid files.

## A new configurable reader interface

So, how else can the newly released version `0.22.3` help?

If you look at the bigger picture then the stability goals for trustless
computation also help all other areas as well. Accidents, misconfiguration and
data corruption happens more often in the real world than we'd like. Too many
hours of work were lost to crashing editors (I've heard both Photoshop and GIMP
cited as prime examples), the root cause being involutnary resource exhaustion.
Being careful with allocation and anticipating errors overlaps with malicious
inputs in this regard.

This also brings us to the newly available interface for reading images:
[`image::io::Reader`][Reader]. It basically unifies all previously existing
functions into a single builder and utility struct. This simplifies many
operations such as reading an image from memory with an automatically deduced
type, or opening a file and inspecting the path deduced format before
processing or overriding the guess from the `image` library.

The improved structure also opens up more possibilities for the next versions.
We plan on bringing a unified interface for configuring memory limits or
maximum sizes so that there is no need to manually inspect potentially
misleading metadata beforehand. It could also be possible to add helpers for
reading only parts of an image, potentially saving cpu time and data reads.
This was hard before due to concerns about the explosion of function
combinations it would spawn.

It is intentionally somewhat minimal to avoid risks of breaking changes, so
feel free to suggest new functionality you can imagine. We're open to feedback.
