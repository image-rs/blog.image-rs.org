title: "Hello, image-rs"

The image related projects have been moved out of the Piston organization. We
are excited to continue the work on image processing under the new group,
`image-rs`. The project remains as much in the hands of the community as before
but freed from the strong ties to the game engine. We'll have two groups of
contributors:

* **Members**, without write access to source code repositories. [Get you
  membership][Member] today. This helps you stay subscribed and shows us and
  everyone else your interest in the project.  Everyone has access to the blog
  and webpage nonetheless, regardless of code contributions. Did you use the
  `image` project in the center of your own application? Can you teach other
  members about color spaces? Know some algorithmic tricks used in other
  libraries or other languages? Such content would fit perfectly while being a
  valuable addition to the cause.
* **Collaborators** are those who have contributed code, to any repository
  under its belt. We'll invite you after an accepted PR or major help to the
  process of integrating code in any other way. This split is mostly intended
  to provide users of the `image-rs` crates with confidence in the integrity of
  the source code.

This post is also meant as a call to the community for collaboration, old and
new. As part of the split and change in leadership, we also try to adapt the
processes within the organization. Now is the chance to define a new and do
some spring cleaning, and *you* can help. The new concept is similar to Rust's
own but even less formal (for now, as we are smaller). We'll collectively
define an overall yearly vision to help with decisions in the face of
uncertainty. Instead of a separate RFC repository, any larger scale changes
