We, the image-rs group, are glad to announce the release of a new version of
the central `image` library. This is especially noteworthy since it resolves
some long standing interface issues, removes some old deprecated items and
marks some new ones, and finally contains a plethora of improvement to the set
of image decoders and encoders.

## Future changes

There are already important plans for the next version. The ecosystem is slowly
moving towards edition 2018, which is now the default for new projects, and
many improvements on quality of life but also semantic clarity are dearly
missed once one has gotten used to them[^1]. Thus, we plan to make the move away
from supporting `rustc 1.24.1`.
